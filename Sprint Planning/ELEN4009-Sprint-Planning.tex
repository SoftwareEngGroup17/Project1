\section{SPRINT PLANNING}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The following document is based on content found within the textbook "Beginning Software Engineering" by Rod Stephens (pages 327 - 329) as well as lecture slides provided by Professor Otoo for the ELEN4009 course at the University of the Witwatersrand (2016). \newline

The adopted method for the software development life cycle (SDLC) was that of SCRUM. In order to ensure that this methodology was carried out in the correct way, a number of details within the project had to be specified.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Scrum Roles}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Product Owner: The customer for this product will be the School of Electrical and Information Engineering within the University of the Witwatersrand.
	\item Users: The users of the product will be the Postgraduate Officer (Ms Mumtaz Adam), Posgraduate Programme Coordinator (Prof. Ivan Hofsajer), the relevant supervisors for a particular applicant's field of interest as well as the applicants themselves.
	\item Other Stakeholders: Student Information and Management Systems (SIMS), which is the department at the university that deals with all information pertaining to an applicant as well as the Student Enrolment Centre (SEnC), that deals with the initial application of the potential students.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specific Team Roles}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Team members: The team members refers to the software development team that will be working on the various modules of the project. This will include Julio Baeta, Nomakhosi Ndebele, Ryan Robinson and Timothy Rokebrand.
	\item Scrum Master: One of the team members was elected to fulfil the role of a leader, which is more commonly known as a 'scrum master' within the context of software engineering projects. This role required the scheduling of meetings, coordinating of group members and clarifying unclear aspects of the project with the course lecturer. Within the scope of this project, the scrum master also acted as one of the team members. Ryan Robinson fulfilled this role for the group.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scrum Sprints}

\hfill \break Due to the nature of the project and the limited scope that would be able to be implemented, sprint planning meetings took place once a week and hence each individual sprint lasted one week. Usually, sprint lengths are between two to four weeks, but due to the nature of the project, this duration had to be reduced in order to ensure that the project was finished on time.

\hfill \break Sprint planning meetings took place every Friday at 10am and concluded either at 12pm or 1pm, thus ensuring that an unnecessarily long amount of time. Generally, the product owner will be present at each sprint planning meeting, however, for this project, the owner (school of EIE) was very specific from the beginning about what they required in terms of functionality and the software's requirements. As a result of this, only one meeting with the product owner was held and a product backlog produced from that meeting. Additional aspects of the project were then obtained through course laboratory exercises, as well as being deduced by the group.

\hfill \break Another aspect of SCRUM is that of a daily scrum meeting.However, due to the software development team members having different commitments and responsibilities, it was not possible for daily scrum meetings to be held. Therefore, the project relied solely on weekly sprint planning meetings.

\hfill \break Usually within industry, a functional module is produced at the end of each sprint. Although some form of software was produced at the end of most sprints, the module produced was not always fully functional. This can be attributed to the lack of experience in the languages and software used by the software developers working on the project.
